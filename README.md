# Game Pacman

I created Pac-Man as a programming study for Swift.
I'm using the SpriteKit framework.
The source code is about 5000 lines, so please refer to it.

You can touch, swipe, and operate Pac-Man with the accelerometer.
There are two types of mazes.

These can be selected on the configuration screen.
